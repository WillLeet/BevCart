BevCart is a deployed mockup of an theoretical online beverage vendor, created by Will Leet, Emil Sharafutdinov, and Matthew Stern. You can browse a list of products, add items to a guest cart or create an account for the ability to save and come back to orders. The website uses pagination to simulate both an extensive userbase and product catalog, and has admin functionality such that certain users can add or remove both products and users. 

You may visit the deployed version of this webiste at https://graceshopper-ewm.herokuapp.com/. 

While this will give you full access to the services our website would provide a customer, if you would like to see the admin features, feel free to email me!
